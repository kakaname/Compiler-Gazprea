*** Attendees:
 Dhanraj (left at 3:00 PM)
 Rajan
 Young
 Yufei
*** Discussion items/agenda:
- Use this meeting to decide on conventions, major project direction
- Base project will be based on chen-hira's vcalc implementation
- Discussion on pass system to be used

1. Conventions
- LLVM style guide
- LLVM's programmer manual
- Use branches/PRs minus the first commits
- Conflict strategy: majority vote
- Testing strategy: write tests, but only able to test near the end, we will
  complete one stage at a time
- Chair will be Dhanraj
- Minutes and scrum leader will be Rajan
- Use GitHub Project Tracker for issues

2. New AST Nodes
- Will be adding Literals and CastTo
- Passes will be added to the project to split AST nodes into smaller nodes for final codegen

3. Type System
- All types will be pointers to a type
- Ex. int and float will be same pointer
- Can perform basic pointer operations on types

*** Member's Progress:
- Dhanraj and Yufei: worked on ASTNodes and Pass manager throughout VCalc
- Will be spliting up work through GitHub
*** Actions:
- Dhanraj: Merge in ASTNodes and Pass manager, finalize it
- Rajan, Yufei, Young: Work on grammar together
*** Outstanding Issues:
- Grammar has to be done ASAP before ASTNodes can be generated
- Have to come up with a list of ASTNodes we want
- Hard to split up tasks when we have no code
*** Round table:
- Rajan: wants to take on the first bit of the grammar
- Young: wants to start writing unit tests
- Dhanraj: will be finishing up the pass manager as required
- Yufei: will be working on the grammar after Rajan, and finalizing ASTNodes

*** Attendees:
 Dhanraj
 Rajan
 Young
 Yufei
*** Member's Progress:
- Rajan: Finished base grammar
- Young: Very basic implementation of unit tests
- Dhanraj: 50% ASTNodes and Pass manager, started working on basic passes
- Yufei: Started working on ASTBuilder, copy from VCalc
*** Discussion items/agenda:
1. Grammar
- Rajan finished the grammar, still a lot of issues
- Will be pushing today for everyone to have a look
- Used C grammar as the base, ANTLR page great resource for grammar

2. Nodes
- Tuples will probably be the hardest part?
- Need a node for Casts, Identity and Null

3. Tuples
- Deconstruct them for all operations

4. Reading Week Plan
- Discussed and in GitHub Project

*** Outstanding Issues:
- We have our own work, but we need to combine the conflicts to ensure it works together.
- All operations depend on eachother
*** Actions/Round table:
- Rajan wiil upload a list of ASTs to the repo, to guide the rest of us
- Dhanraj will upload his pass manager to the repo,
- Young will come up with basic codegen logic
- Yufei will work on ASTBuilder

*** Attendees:
 Dhanraj
 Rajan
 Young
 Yufei
*** Member's Progress:
- Rajan: Worked on major runtime functions (output and input streams), compile time errors, codegen for loops/base types/functions, declaration rules
- Young: Worked on base grammar tests, declaration verification
- Yufei: Worked on ASTBuilder, ASTNodes, and most importantly the visitor pass, which includes scoping and type checking
- Dhanraj: Worked on passes, where a lot of these rules should be
*** Discussion items/agenda:
1. Project "Rebase"
- We have been accidentally doing other people's work
- Need to make sure everything works with (mainly) the type system
- Dhanraj will take the reigns on organizing the others' work into smaller passes

2. Types and Declarations
- Come from ExprTypeAnnotationPass

*** Outstanding Issues:
- Rebase stuff with Dhanraj's work
- Type system equivalences do not work as intended (with annotated const information), need to add another method
*** Actions/Round table:
- Rajan: will continue to take on the CodeGen and stream functions (error checking)
- Dhanraj: will complete those passes, based on our work and his type system, and will update us
- Young: will work on compilation error recognition
- Yufei: will work on the visitor pass, and will ensure scoping is done

- Dhanraj: Worked on passes, where a lot of these rules should be
*** Discussion items/agenda:
1. Project streamlining
- workflow has hit lots of deadlock, due to misorganization, talked about how to give tasks to specific people

2. Part 2 approach
- How will we handle the new ast nodes, memory management, new types

*** Outstanding Issues:
- Reorganize and clean code as it is all clumped up and dirty
- Matrices and vectors need to be done in order for any work on concat or strings
*** Actions/Round table:
- Rajan: will begin work on basic blueprinting for vector types
- Dhanraj: will reorganize codebase, and clean up code
- Young: will work on new unit tests, and assist in vector blueprinting
- Yufei: will work on fixing unattended to bugs, real literals

*** Attendees:
 Dhanraj
 Rajan
 Young
 Yufei
*** Member's Progress:
- Rajan: Almost finished with vector types
- Young: Unit tests are all finished
- Dhanraj: All code has been reorganized, and re structured
- Yufei: Previous bugs that persisted have been fixed, real literals have begun work on
*** Discussion items/agenda:
1. Vectors, Matrices
- Vectors and Matrices need to be finished or there will be deadlock.

2. Nodes
- Tuple destructuring needs to be done
- Built-in functions should be a ASTNode

3. Competitive tests
- take all errors from competitive tests, and fix them, also integrate those tests into our own tests

4. Reading Week Plan
- Discussed and in GitHub Project

*** Outstanding Issues:
- Real literals, and bugs from competitive tests come first
- Vectors and Matrices must be done in order to continue work on other parts
*** Actions/Round table:
- Rajan will finish vectors
- Dhanraj will finish matrices
- Young will finish strings and built-ins
- Yufei will finish memory allocation

 Yufei
*** Member's Progress:
- Rajan: Vectors have been finished
- Young: Strings and constant folding pass has been finished
- Yufei: Real-literal bug is finished, so is most of memory freeing
- Dhanraj: Type promotion checking, and Matrix literals are almot done
*** Discussion items/agenda:
1. How to handle built-ins
- Should be ast nodes

2. Types and Declarations
- Should string be it's own type or should it be an extension of a vector?

*** Outstanding Issues:
- memory still not finished
- built ins need to be done
- Filters and generators must be done
*** Actions/Round table:
- Rajan: will finish all runtimes for vectors and matrices
- Dhanraj: will complete filters, as well as type checking and casting
- Young: will work on built-ins, as well as testcases
- Yufei: will work on generator
